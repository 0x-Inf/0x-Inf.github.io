        <p>The following post starts with a question, like all good discussions.
How can we humans best realize the world? This question could have lotâ€™s of answers, ranging from
the metaphysical to the religious to simply being. Now as you can tell from the title of the post
this will somehow involve some mathematics. Well, you are right. This is somewhat an attempt to convince you
and perhaps also me of why we use mathematics to get a grip on the realness of the world. As a subject of study mathematics
has been there since at least the greeks.</p>
